### Poster Designs
#### Goudy Poster
The Goudy font is an Old Style serif typeface
designed by Frederic W. Goudy. This particular font had
many unusual yet unique characteristics such as
diamond-shaped dots and curved ears on the lowercase
“g”. Goudy had initially stated that he was inspired by the
cap lettering on a Renaissance painting, which often told
a narrative of a chapter through a letter and other
curvature, nature-like designs. As this font was often
used for the American printing press in the early
twentieth century, I decided I wanted to create a cap
lettering motif and unfold a printing of letterings as the
narrative for the poster. It took many trials in
experimenting, but it was a great experience to
see what different ideas could unfold through
this single Goudy font.
#### Senufo Stool 
The Senufo Stool is a chair that has been hand
carved from a single block of wood by the Senufo
Tribe of the Ivory Coast (Africa). This poster is a
campaign for a Iconic Chair Exhibition sponsored
by the Drexel Department of Architecture, Design
& Urbanism. I wanted to incorporate the cultural
designs of the Senufo tribe while accentuating the
hand-carved texture of the stool (which is the
quality it which made each stool unique).

#### The Creation of Onni
Founded in 2002, Pennoni Honors College (PHC) at Drexel University recognizes and promotes excellence among its students. PHC provides a vibrant space with diverse programs and services that foster academic, professional, and personal growth.

The newly rebranded merchandise for Drexel’s Welcome Week Events (Fall 2024) marks a significant departure from previous themes, reflecting a fresh and dynamic approach. This rebrand highlights Pennoni Honors College as integral to the Drexel experience, emphasizing friendliness, relatability, and fun for incoming freshmen.

To develop the Fall merchandise and branding for Pennoni Honors College, it was crucial to understand what incoming freshmen value and what makes the Drexel experience unique. Simplicity, versatility, and inclusivity—qualities popular among Generation Z—guided the design, drawing inspiration from characters like Sonny Angels, Smiskis, Hello Kitty, and Calvin and Hobbes.

To ensure a cohesive theme for the Fall merchandise and branding, a Google survey was distributed to the PHC staff for their input. While PHC traditionally used a standard Drexel logo, there was a strong desire for a unique element or character representation specifically for the Fall launch.

The merchandise was designed to be distributed free of cost to incoming freshmen during the Fall, with the goal of introducing them to Pennoni Honors College. The aim was to create a memorable first impression and encourage freshmen to engage more deeply with Pennoni from the start of their Drexel journey.

This research process began by observing unique aspects of Drexel campus life and identifying trends that resonate with Generation Z, both in physical and digital spaces. Adjectives like relatable, friendly, and fun were the primary drivers behind this approach.

Key aspects of Drexel’s campus life, such as local cafés, food trucks, volleyball courts, Lancaster Avenue vendors, and the mascot "Mario the Magnificent," were also considered to ensure the merchandise reflected the vibrancy and diversity of the Drexel community.

The creation of "Onni," a Drexel dog character whose name is derived from "Pennoni," embodies the spirit of Pennoni Honors College. As a campus enthusiast, Onni promotes active student life engagement. Sketches of Onni were developed to showcase actions that will inspire and connect future incoming freshmen with PHC.

#### The Star Program
The STAR (Students Tackling Advanced Research) Scholars Program is an opportunity for highly motivated first-year students to engage in an early faculty-mentored undergraduate research, scholarship, or creative experience during the summer after their freshman year. This highly competitive co-curricular educational program seeks to identify and encourage students to take a hands-on approach to their education through undergraduate research.

My branding for their final presentations reflect their unique ability to dive into all different topics of research.

#### PCA Rebrand
Founded in 1973, The Philadelphia Corporation for Aging (PCA) is a
nationally recognized Area Agency on Aging and is primarily funded to help
older Philadelphians and those with disabilities achieve their maximum
levels of health, independence, and productivity through the provided
services and programs.

The PCA rebrand is an evolution of the current brand, aiming to highlight the
positive and enriching life the older generation holds in their independence
with the assistance of the organization’s services and programs
