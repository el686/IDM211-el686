## About Me
 ### Hey, it’s Esther!
It’s nice to meet you ^_^ I am a designer who enjoys creating & developing visuals that bring artistic visions to life! With a fine arts background, a Bachelor of Graphic Design, and an Interactive Digital Media minor at Drexel University, my work focuses on brand identity, illustration, and typography layouts. I’ve recently found an interest in creating stickers too. You can find me roaming Philadelphia for nice cafes & magazine shops.
### Let's Connect!
